This project is an incomplete project. I wanted to create a simple program with a ball and a foot, and the goal was to keep the ball in the air. Every time the foot hit the ball you get a point, and If you drop the ball you lose. Currently that ball tends to fall to the left side of the screen and it won’t bounce on the foot, which is necessary.

The way I coded the program was, of course, by using the p5 play library. The library used a bunch of examples of games. I looked at flappy bird, pong and breakout, extracting specific lines of code to complete the programme. I used a lot of time trying to create something actually playable, which Is clear if you look on the lines of code. There are some lines which aren’t even in use, just to show which problems I have tried to fix. 

The class created in the program was meant to have a not just be a copy paste code of Daniel Shiftman. I wanted to used text or pictures of currency to fly every time you hit the ball. I wanted to address the extreme inflation of prices of football player’s wages and the business surrounding them.

This is an incomplete/unfinished program which I didn’t manage to complete in time.

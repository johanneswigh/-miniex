In my program, I thought of what fun means for me. That is why I made a rather provocative program. On the screen, there is a sign that says click here. But the text moves accordingly to the mouse, so you would never be able to click it. I imagine the  frustration the user who keeps trying to click, but every time you click a text that reads ‘’YOU LOSE’’ it keeps enlarging. In the background, three faces of what is supposed to be clown figures floats through the screen while a very annoying sound file of me humming a circus themed sound is playing. This would be very annoying and give a sense of ridiculousness, which is my notion of fun.

I used a lot of variations to get the heads moving. I wanted to add more annoying and distracting features like a nose that is blinking red and more heads, which obviously should look my like clowns, and perhaps inserting a picture of a circus instead. It is all possible to do, but with limited time, I am satisfied with the level of annoyances I my impact the user. I learnt a lot about variations, adding sound, X and Y-axis in programming and working with larger chunks of code. 

 Goriunova's describe the notion of fun in parts of her text as purposeless. This is very much what my program represents. It also confronts the aspect of programming that is should be rational and progressive. This is a program which seems to have no purpose other than annoy, but it might just be adding to critical thinking about the software as only pragmatic.

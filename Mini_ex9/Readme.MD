The program that i chose to use:

Flowchart:

The difficult aspect of building this flowchart is what to focus on. The more you focus on the program, the less you focus on the code. If you solely focus on the code, it would not be understandable for an non-programmer. I tried to build this flowchart a place in between. 

Flowchart with Twitter API:
![alt tekst](https://github.com/johanneswigh/-miniex/blob/master/Mini_ex9/Twitter%20Hetoo.png?raw=true)

This program will search through twitters API and collecting the hashtag #metoo. It would then look for words like him, his, her, woman, man, and so on, and replacing with the opposit word. This way, he becomes she, hers become his etc. Then it would post this on a male account. 

There a quite a few techincal challenges espacially working out how to replace an occuring word and getting access to the tweets. There might also be problems with all the bots, tweets in other languages and people using the hashtag to someting other than attended. We hope that the twitter API will be easy to acces and a simple code can do the trick with replacing words. Bots and other languages will be difficult if not impossible to avoid.

Flowharts represents an algortithm. By using it as a recipe for building a program and understanding the processes. In this way by reading a flowchart you understan the program and the way it is build.

Flowchart with Facebook metricator
![alt tekst](https://github.com/johanneswigh/-miniex/blob/master/Mini_ex9/Metricator.png?raw=true)

This program is heavily inspired by the demitricator. Though isntead of hiding the metrics on Facebook it will make them extra visible. Instead of ''4 persons likes this'' it will show how many havent liked the post yet. When you start the program you see the normal facebook layout and it lets you write a post. The post will show how many that havent like it yet. 

The program is actuaclly really simple and only consists of a few buttons. The diffucult part will be the animations of making a post and inserting it into the feed.

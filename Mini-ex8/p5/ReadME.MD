This program was a collabaration between Mikael // https://github.com/mikaelkorsholm and i.

Our program is called: 

Our program is using the GIPHY API. We began exploring the opportunities of the GIPHY API, i quite fast figured how to extract an image with a search word in the API. We expanded the program by adding a button. The button has written ''Anything'' in it, to give a notion of freedom to search for whatever you want. But in reality it gives the user a search word, that they most likely will use if they can't come up with anything.

When we created the program, we wanted to create a more critical edge, by trying to reflect upon the capitalism in search engines. If we think of google, the most popular search engine, there is only a limited number of websites which is shown. That is way Google exploits this by selling the tops spots to the highest payer. This creates some unfair advantages for big companies while undermining the small companies, which will most likely never have the financial strength to get as much visibility as a big company.

We visualised this by secretly adding words to the search word in the program. In our code, we added the strongest financial business. So by every word you search for, there is a secret name of a company added, influencing the search result.

In the future, I would like to investigate further on the possibilities of an API. Both the opportunities for creating new content from an API, and critically investigating what how it affects the society and what kind of data a business can retrieve from these APIâ€™s

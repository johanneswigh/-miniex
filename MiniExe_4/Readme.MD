In this program i interpreted ’capture all’ as critique of making a bussines out of data and therefor making it profitiable to survale and capture extremely personal data through the internet. I wanted to visualize this data capture as extreme as I possible could. This way the user may think of data capture in a less relaxed way. That is way I created it the program as negative as possible. 

The program uses the webcam, which is slowly covered by a black canvas. When the canvas moves over your face, it turns key-points of your face into green squares. This is to make the user fell that they are transferring from the real world into a world of data. In the background there are Ones and zeroes in green floating through the canvas, to represent the data which is supposed to transfer your personal information. 

The program gives me a way of visualize the data transfer which happens constantly on the internet. Not long ago created a webshop for a client and of course used Google analytics, Google AdWords and Google Merchant, all of these which sells and captures data on a website. Now a person like me can see which a visitor uses, where in the country they are from, what page they are on in the exact moment and a lot more information. Personally, if think it’s very critical how a single company is able to gather so much information about the users of the internet. 

Returning to comment on my program I ran into some difficulties. I couldn’t figure out a way to the canvas a maximum x-value, so it keeps growing. I also wanted to add more lines of ones and zeroes and making them endless, but it was slowing the program down a lot. Overall I’m still satisfied with the program which stills gets my point across even with a few flaws.

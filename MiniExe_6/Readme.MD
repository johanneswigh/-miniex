In this mini_ex the focus has been on generativity. We were given a task to choose three rules which should be implemented in the program. I began the process of designing a program by looking for inspiration. I found a program which generated mountains by a random function, so everytime the program was refreshed a new mountain landscape formed. I wanted to make a similar program, but instead using a noise function which continuously formed new mountains which moved across the screen.

My three rules:
A sun that moves up and down (sunrise and sundown)
Endless moving mountains created with the noise function.
A background changing colour depending on sunrise or sundown.

The mountains keep having new shapes which are different for each user, the sun and background will change in same speed and colours for every user.  The mountains are in this way generative as they keep evolving and giving a different impression for every user. This way the program helped me see generative programs as something which is unique for every user. A program which in some degree isnâ€™t controllable by me (the programmer) but by the program which generates mountains using the noise function. 

I ran into some technical issues. I managed getting the sun go up and down and changing background colours without the mountains but not with the mountains. I ended up with a compromise where the sun only goes down, with the background only changing one time from blue to orange but the mountains keeps generating.

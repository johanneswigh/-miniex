*Throbber MiniExe_3*

In this project, I tried to create the worst throbber and loading screen possible. I used an old outdated browser window as background, which immediately gives the user a feeling of using old and slow computers with terrible internet speed. The loading bar adds to this conceptualisation of old and slow, which is why I created it in these ‘’classic’’ colours and the same goes for the loading text. The actual throbber, isn’t a classic throbber as we usually see them. It is in form of text which reads ‘’Wait’’. The appearance of text is randomized which also the size and placement is. This gives the illusion of a broken throbber and page. Meanwhile a loading sound is playing, which keeps repeating. I used a time-related syntax (frameRate(random(3)), which is randomized, to give an unpleasant feeling of landing on this page. 

The throbber Is a solution which has nothing to do with the actual loading on a page. It us only designed to please the user. The throbber gives a sense of working from the computer. We believe the computer is processing data, and the throbber is the visualisation of this. It’s become important for software to use this, because we are so used to it. If a throbber is missing from loading software we immediately suspect it is not working, or has crashed. That is why a throbber and of course a proper one Is necessary.

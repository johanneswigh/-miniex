My first independent coding expiring was a bit of a challenge. I started from scratch with no coding experience. I began my project with help from the assigned Youtube videos, which got me started with creating a canvas, background and an ellipse. After getting started with the basic code set, I started to experiment with different objects; triangles and squares in different sizes. This gave me a basic understanding about changing sizes with colour changing soon following. I constantly modified and updated the project to get an understanding of each value. I soon looked around the web, to see what actually what is possible. I found a code that made an ellipse different colours that changed when moving the mouse. It was a long and very complicated code, but again I kept modifying and changing values to get a better knowledge of each line of code. From my knowledge about objects I changed the ellipse to text and fixated it, changed the canvas size, made the background black and also changed the colour settings for the changing colours. I made this ‘’hide n seek’’ project based on the opportunities which slowly was revealing itself when changing each line of code. All in all, it was by modifying testing and reading finished projects code which got me started with this project.

Coding for me turned out to be a lot like writing a text in a second language, the difference may be that you instantly can check if your choice of words/code is 100% correct when coding. You start with almost no knowledge but with some basic code set and experimenting you quickly learn, what each piece of code means. By this way you slowly progress through learning the language.

From a personal perspective, it can give an opportunity to express myself differently. If I want to draw something, it’s easy to visualize it. With programming, I have to enter a medium where I have to modify my thoughts to what is possibly. I have to think in new ways and learn how to communicate with the program. This may sound like it’s a limitation but its gives another dimension to my creativity. My project was a circle with a static colour but when I began to explore the possibilities I came up with new ways of thinking of the project and came up with a much better and cleverer project (from my perspective). This way of thinking may also be used in a bigger context. That is way coding can be very meaningful way to face a problem and give it new dimension.
